# Express.js Note Taker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
Express Note Taker is a simple application designed to help users write and save notes. It utilizes an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application provides a user-friendly interface for organizing thoughts and keeping track of tasks.

### Problem Solving
Express Note Taker addresses the need for a lightweight note-taking application that can be easily deployed and accessed from any device. By leveraging Express.js and JSON file storage, the application offers a straightforward solution for managing notes.

### Learning
I gained experience in building a back end for a web application using Express.js. I learned how to create routes to handle HTTP requests, interact with file storage, and manage data persistence. Additionally, the project enhances skills in HTML, CSS, and client-server communication.
